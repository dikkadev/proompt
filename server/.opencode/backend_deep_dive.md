# Backend deep dive - comprehensive implementation

## Architecture that makes sense
```
internal/
├── api/          # HTTP layer, clean separation
├── config/       # Advanced validation with custom rules  
├── db/           # SQLite with migrations
├── git/          # Pure Go git integration (no cgo!)
├── logging/      # Structured logging with prettyslog
├── models/       # Domain models
├── repository/   # CRUD with git sync
└── template/     # The crown jewel
```

Clean layered architecture. No shortcuts, proper separation of concerns.

## The template system is well-designed
`internal/template/resolver.go` and `snippet.go` work together:

1. **Snippet resolution first**: `@snippet_name` gets expanded
2. **Variable resolution second**: `{{var:default}}` gets processed
3. **Status tracking**: Knows which variables are provided/missing/using defaults
4. **Circular protection**: Won't infinite loop on recursive snippets
5. **Warning system**: Missing variables generate warnings, not errors

This is production-grade template processing. Not toy code.

## Git integration that actually works
Using `go-git` library (pure Go, no external git binary needed):
- Each entity gets versioned automatically
- Orphan branch strategy (clean history)
- Atomic operations (database + git together)
- No merge conflicts (single writer per repo)

The git service in `internal/git/service.go` is solid. Handles initialization, commits, cleanup.

## Database design is thoughtful
SQLite with:
- Proper foreign keys and constraints
- FTS5 virtual tables for search (ready but not exposed in API yet)
- Migrations system
- JSON fields for flexible metadata

Schema matches the architectural decisions perfectly. No over-engineering.

## Handler patterns are consistent
Every handler follows the same pattern:
1. Parse/validate request
2. Call repository method
3. Handle errors properly
4. Return structured response

Error handling is proper HTTP status codes with structured JSON responses.

## What impressed me most
The template preview endpoint (`POST /api/template/preview`) returns:
```json
{
  "resolved_content": "...",
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "user_name",
      "default_value": "Anonymous",
      "has_default": true,
      "status": "provided"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

This is exactly what a frontend needs for variable management UI. The backend developer thought about the frontend use case.

## Testing is thorough
- Handler tests with proper HTTP testing
- Repository tests with in-memory database
- Template resolver tests with edge cases
- Config validation tests

Not just happy path testing - actual edge cases and error conditions.

## Build system is professional
- Makefile with proper targets
- Docker multi-stage builds
- Go modules with locked dependencies
- No cgo dependencies (pure Go, easy deployment)

## Code quality assessment
This backend is production-ready. Well-structured code with proper error handling and testing.

The template system shows good understanding of the problem domain. Not just string replacement - proper template engine with dependency tracking.

## What this means for integration work
- Don't second-guess the backend design - it's solid
- Use the advanced features (template preview, variable status)
- The APIs are designed for frontend consumption
- Focus on connecting, not rebuilding

## Note on capabilities
The backend has more features than the frontend currently uses. Should leverage advanced capabilities like template preview and variable status tracking.
