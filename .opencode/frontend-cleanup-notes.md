# Frontend Project Cleanup - Complete

## Server-side Code Analysis ✅
**RESULT: No server-side code found**
- Pure client-side React SPA 
- No SSR, no API routes, no Next.js server functions
- Vite dev server config is just for development
- Uses react-router-dom for client-side routing

## Project Setup Cleanup ✅

### Package.json - DRAMATICALLY simplified
**Removed 28 packages** including:
- Unnecessary Radix components (accordion, alert-dialog, avatar, checkbox, collapsible, etc.)
- Unused libraries (date-fns, embla-carousel, recharts, react-colorful, vaul, input-otp)
- Build dependencies (postcss, @tailwindcss/typography)

**Kept essential dependencies:**
- Core React ecosystem
- TanStack Query for API calls
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms  
- Essential Radix components (dialog, dropdown, select, tooltip, etc.)
- Tailwind v4 + utilities
- React Router for navigation

### Configuration Files
- **PostCSS config**: ❌ DELETED (unnecessary with Tailwind v4 Vite plugin)
- **Vite config**: ✅ KEPT (minimal and perfect)
- **TSconfig**: ✅ KEPT (appropriate for prototyping, relaxed settings)
- **ESLint**: ✅ KEPT (minimal, suitable)
- **components.json**: ✅ SIMPLIFIED (removed unused aliases)

### Build Verification ✅
- `bun install`: ✅ Works, removed 28 packages, installed 10
- `bun run build`: ✅ Successful build (464KB JS, 81KB CSS)
- TypeScript: Minor shadcn component errors but compilation works

## Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
Frontend is now much leaner and focused on core functionality.
Ready to implement actual API integration and fix broken functionality.
