# Integration reality - the good, bad, and ugly

## The good: More connected than I expected
When I first looked, I thought "oh no, another beautiful frontend with no backend". But actually:

- Health check is real and working (shows green/red status in UI)
- TanStack Query is properly configured with query keys and cache management
- API client has proper error handling and TypeScript types
- The data is flowing: I can see real prompts from the backend in the UI

## The bad: Data model mismatches everywhere
The frontend was clearly designed with different assumptions:

**Snippets expect**:
```typescript
category?: string;      // For sidebar grouping
tags?: string[];        // For filtering  
isFavorite?: boolean;   // For favorites section
```

**Backend provides**:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "title": "...", 
  "content": "...",
  "description": "..."
}
```

This breaks the entire snippet sidebar organization. The UI tries to group by category but gets `undefined`.

## The ugly: Template preview is completely disconnected
This is the most frustrating part. The backend has this incredible template system:

```bash
# Backend can do this:
POST /api/template/preview
{
  "content": "Hello {{name:World}}! @greeting_snippet",
  "variables": {"name": "Alice"}
}

# Returns:
{
  "resolved_content": "Hello Alice! Welcome to our platform!",
  "variables": [
    {"name": "name", "status": "provided", "has_default": true}
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

But the frontend does this amateur regex parsing:
```typescript
const variables = content.match(/\{\{([^}]+)\}\}/g) || [];
```

Significant underutilization of backend capabilities.

## My debugging journey
1. **Started server**: `./proompt` - works fine
2. **Tested health**: `curl /api/health` - perfect JSON response
3. **Tested prompts**: `curl /api/prompts` - 15 real prompts with template syntax
4. **Opened frontend**: Beautiful UI, but...
5. **Checked network tab**: Only health and basic list calls, no template preview
6. **Read PromptEditor.tsx**: Local variable parsing, no backend calls
7. **Checked SnippetSidebar.tsx**: Tries to access fields that don't exist

## Current reality
Mixed state - high quality pieces that aren't properly connected.

**Positive**: All components are well-built
**Issue**: Integration is incomplete

## What I learned about the codebase
- The backend developer really understood the problem domain
- The frontend developer made reasonable assumptions but didn't have the final backend schema
- The integration was started but not finished
- Both sides are high quality, just misaligned

## Current state breakdown
**Working**: Basic data fetching, UI interactions, server stability
**Broken**: Template processing, snippet organization, advanced features
**Missing**: Connection between frontend needs and backend capabilities

## Path forward
This is a connection problem, not a rebuild problem. Both frontend and backend are well-implemented.

Key insight: Don't rebuild working components. Focus on proper integration between existing pieces.

## Working context
Both sides make sense in their own context. Need to align the interfaces and data models.
