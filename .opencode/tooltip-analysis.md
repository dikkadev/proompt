# Tooltip Issue Analysis

## Problem: Tooltips Not Disappearing

The tooltips in the application are not disappearing, which creates a poor user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Multiple TooltipProvider Instances
The application has **conflicting TooltipProvider setups**:

1. **Global TooltipProvider** in `App.tsx` (line 12)
2. **Individual TooltipProviders** in many components:
   - `MainSidebar.tsx` (line 217) with `delayDuration={100}`
   - `LivePreview.tsx` (lines 205, 221, 251, 267)
   - `PromptEditor.tsx` (lines 190, 239)
   - `VariablePanel.tsx` (lines 126, 157, 222)
   - `ColorPicker.tsx` (multiple instances)

### Issue 2: Nested Provider Conflicts
When components create their own TooltipProvider while already inside the global one, this can cause:
- Event handler conflicts
- State management issues
- Tooltip lifecycle problems
- Multiple tooltip contexts interfering with each other

### Issue 3: Configuration Inconsistencies
- Global provider: No specific configuration
- MainSidebar provider: `delayDuration={100}`
- Other providers: Default configuration

## Technical Details

### Radix UI Tooltip Behavior
- TooltipProvider manages the global state for all tooltips
- Multiple providers can interfere with each other's event handling
- Tooltip dismissal relies on proper event propagation and state management

### Current Architecture Issues
1. **Provider Redundancy**: Each tooltip creates its own provider
2. **Event Bubbling**: Multiple providers can intercept dismiss events
3. **State Conflicts**: Nested providers compete for tooltip state management

## Immediate Impact
- Tooltips remain visible after mouse leave
- Poor user experience
- Potential accessibility issues
- UI elements become cluttered with persistent tooltips
