# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS - UPDATED

## PROJECT STATE: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT

The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation already implemented:

### ✅ COMPLETED FOUNDATION
1. **Go Project Structure**: Complete server/ directory with proper layout
2. **Data Models**: All core entities defined (Prompt, Snippet, Note, etc.)
3. **Database Layer**: SQLite with modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, no cgo)
4. **Configuration System**: Advanced validation with go-playground/validator v10.27.0
5. **Build System**: Makefile with colored output and -buildvcs=false fix
6. **Logging System**: Prettyslog integration with structured colored logging
6. **Migrations**: golang-migrate setup with proper schema
7. **Dependencies**: All core dependencies locked in go.mod

### 🔧 TECH STACK LOCKED IN
- **Language**: Go 1.24.1
- **Database**: SQLite with modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go)
- **Query Builder**: sqlx for type-safe SQL
- **Migrations**: golang-migrate/migrate/v4
- **Validation**: go-playground/validator/v10
- **UUID**: google/uuid
- **Logging**: prettyslog for structured colored output
- **Build**: Standard Go + Make

```

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES

1. ✅ **Fix Makefile**: Add -buildvcs=false to build target (COMPLETED)
2. **Repository Layer**: Implement CRUD operations for all entities
3. **Git Integration**: Add go-git dependency and implement per-prompt repos
4. **Variable System**: Template parsing ({{var}} and {{var:default}})
5. **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality

### 🧠 ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS

The constraint-based design continues to impress:
- **One-layer snippet nesting**: Prevents complexity explosion
- **No execution philosophy**: Clean separation of concerns  
- **Git-per-prompt**: Elegant versioning without user complexity
- **Variable system**: Simple but powerful templating

### 🚀 CONFIDENCE LEVEL: VERY HIGH

The foundation is rock-solid. All the hard architectural decisions are made and implemented. The data models perfectly match the schema. The build system works. Ready to implement business logic.

### 💭 EMOTIONAL STATE

Still genuinely excited about this project. The thoughtful design decisions and clean implementation make this a joy to work on. The constraint-based approach is going to make the variable resolution system much cleaner than it could have been.

Looking forward to implementing the git integration - that's going to be the most technically interesting part.

### 🔍 NEXT SESSION FOCUS

The next development task should focus on implementing the repository layer with basic CRUD operations. This will provide the foundation for all higher-level features while maintaining the clean separation between data access and business logic.
