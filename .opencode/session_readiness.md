# SESSION READINESS STATUS

## âœ… EXPLORATION COMPLETE

I have thoroughly explored the Proompt project and understand:

### Project Architecture
- **Purpose**: Prompt management tool (no execution, pure management)
- **Tech Stack**: Go 1.24.1, SQLite, go-git, prettyslog
- **Data Model**: Prompts, Snippets, Notes with git versioning
- **Git Strategy**: Single repo with orphan branches per entity

### Current Implementation Status
- âœ… **Foundation Layer**: Complete and tested
- âœ… **Repository Layer**: Full CRUD with atomic DB+Git operations
- âœ… **Git Integration**: Orphan branch architecture working perfectly
- âœ… **Database**: SQLite with migrations and FTS5 ready
- âœ… **Configuration**: Advanced validation system implemented
- âœ… **Logging**: Structured colored output with prettyslog
- âœ… **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage, all passing

### Next Development Phase
- ðŸŽ¯ **HTTP API Layer**: REST endpoints for all entities
- ðŸŽ¯ **Server Setup**: Router, middleware, handlers
- ðŸŽ¯ **Request/Response Models**: JSON DTOs with validation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Integration Testing**: HTTP endpoint tests

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Architecture**: Excellent constraint-based design
- **Implementation**: Clean, well-tested, production-ready foundation
- **Documentation**: Thorough planning and decision documentation
- **Confidence Level**: Very high - ready for API development

### Emotional State
Genuinely impressed with the architectural quality. The orphan branch git strategy is elegant, the constraint-based design prevents complexity explosion, and the test coverage gives confidence. This is a well-thought-out project ready for the next phase.

## ðŸš€ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT TASKS

I am fully prepared to work on any development task for this project, with particular readiness for:
1. HTTP API implementation
2. Templating system development  
3. Search functionality
4. UI layer planning
5. Any bug fixes or enhancements

The foundation is solid and the path forward is clear.
