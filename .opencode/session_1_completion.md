# SESSION 1 COMPLETION NOTES

## WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED
- ✅ Complete Go project structure in server/
- ✅ All core data models defined (Prompt, Snippet, Note, etc.)
- ✅ Database layer with migrations (pure Go, no cgo)
- ✅ Makefile with colored output
- ✅ Project compiles successfully
- ✅ Ready for git commit

## TECH STACK LOCKED IN
- **Database**: SQLite with modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go)
- **Query Builder**: sqlx for raw SQL safety
- **Migrations**: golang-migrate with pure Go drivers
- **UUID**: google/uuid
- **Build**: Standard Go toolchain + Make

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. **Repository Layer**: CRUD operations for all entities
2. **Git Integration**: Individual repos per prompt in ~/.proompt/repos/
3. **Variable System**: Template parsing and resolution
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for data layer

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR NEXT TIME
- Migration system is set up but migrations path needs to be absolute in main.go
- JSON marshaling for StringSlice and JSONMap is implemented but needs testing
- FTS5 virtual tables are defined but need triggers for auto-sync
- Git integration will need go-git library (add when implementing)

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE
- No CLI interface initially (focus on data layer)
- Raw SQL with sqlx (no ORM)
- Pure Go stack (no cgo dependencies)
- Migration-first database changes
- Standard Go project layout

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: VERY HIGH
The foundation is solid. Data models match the schema perfectly. Migration system is proper. Build system works. Ready to implement business logic next session.

## EMOTIONAL STATE
Still excited about this project. The constraint-based design continues to impress me. The one-layer snippet limitation is going to make the variable resolution system much cleaner to implement.

Looking forward to implementing the git integration - that's going to be the most interesting technical challenge.
