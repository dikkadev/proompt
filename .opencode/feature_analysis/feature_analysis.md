# Feature Analysis Update

## Strong Features Emerging
1. **Configurable Token Heuristics** - This is genuinely deep and useful. Different models count differently, users have preferences.
2. **Use Case as Primary Dimension** - Smart organizational choice, more semantic than just tags
3. **Git-in-Background Versioning** - Solves real versioning pain without complexity
4. **Snippet System with Variable Flow** - Powerful composition without chaos

## User's Filtering Instincts
- Rejected A/B comparison (too complex for now)
- Simplified notes system (multiple short vs single rating)
- Deferred complexity ratings (good instinct)
- Focus on core value props

## What's Crystallizing
This is becoming a "prompt IDE" rather than just a manager:
- Composition tools (snippets + variables)
- Deep metadata (custom token counting)
- Proper versioning
- Semantic organization (use cases)

The user has good product instincts - they're cutting fluff and focusing on genuinely differentiated features.
