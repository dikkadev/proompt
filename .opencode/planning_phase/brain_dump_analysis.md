# Brain Dump Analysis - Prompt Manager Vision

## Key Insights from User's Brain Dump

### The Spectrum Problem
User defined a clear spectrum:
- (A) Langfuse/Anthropic workbenches: Full execution + evaluation tools (too much for their use case)
- (B) Simple note/snippet apps with tags: Just CRUD + search (too little, not specialized enough)
- **Target**: Somewhere in between - prompt-specific features without execution

### Critical Constraint: NO EXECUTION
- User explicitly doesn't want to execute prompts in the app
- They have other tools for that already
- This is purely about MANAGEMENT, not TESTING/EVALUATION

### The "Why Bother?" Question
User is questioning if this is worth building at all unless we can identify:
- Prompt-specific features that justify the effort
- Something beyond just "database with UI and tags"
- Features that actually pertain to the prompt management use case

### My Instinctual Reactions
- This is a smart constraint - execution is complex and already solved
- The "in between" space is actually underserved
- Need to identify what makes prompt management different from general note management
- The user's skepticism is healthy - we need to prove value

### Questions This Raises
- What are prompt-specific pain points that generic note apps don't solve?
- What metadata/structure is unique to prompts?
- How do people actually organize and find prompts in practice?
- What workflows are specific to prompt iteration/versioning?
