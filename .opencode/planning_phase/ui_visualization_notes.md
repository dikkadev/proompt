# UI Visualization for Variables

## Color Coding System
- Red: Missing variables (will show warning)
- Yellow: Variables with defaults 
- Green: Variables provided by current prompt context

## Where to Show This
- Snippet browser when selecting snippets
- Maybe in snippet preview when inserting
- Possibly in prompt editor when snippet is inserted

## Solves Multiple Issues
- Shows dependencies clearly
- Indicates override situations
- Helps debug unexpected behavior
- Guides users to provide missing variables

User seems satisfied with this approach - simple but effective.
