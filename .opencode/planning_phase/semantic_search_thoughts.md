# Semantic Search Feature Analysis

## The Vision
User types: "I want to write better code reviews"
System returns: Ordered list of prompts that help with code review tasks

## Technical Approaches

### Option 1: Simple Embeddings
- Embed prompt content + metadata
- Embed user query
- Cosine similarity ranking
- Pros: Simple, fast, works reasonably well
- Cons: May miss nuanced intent, hard to tune

### Option 2: Hybrid Search
- Combine embeddings with keyword search
- Weight by use case, tags, content
- Pros: More robust, leverages structured data
- Cons: More complex tuning

### Option 3: LLM-Assisted Ranking
- Use LLM to score relevance of each prompt to query
- Pros: Very nuanced understanding
- Cons: Expensive, slower, needs API calls

## The "No Good Matches" Problem
What when user asks for something we don't have?
- Show best matches with low confidence scores?
- Suggest creating new prompt?
- Show empty results with suggestion to refine query?

## User's Insight
"Idk if just embedding would be good enough here"
- Shows awareness that this is non-trivial
- Suggests they want something better than basic similarity
- Need to think about quality thresholds
