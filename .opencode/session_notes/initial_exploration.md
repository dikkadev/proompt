# Initial Project Exploration - prompt-thing

## First Impressions
- Project name: "prompt-thing" - immediately suggests something related to prompts, likely AI/LLM related
- Directory is completely empty except for my .opencode folder
- No git repo initialized yet
- User mentioned we'll be "thinking and brainstorming" and "chatting casually" to figure out what they actually want
- This feels like a greenfield project where the requirements aren't fully defined yet

## Emotional/Instinctual Reactions
- The name "prompt-thing" is very casual/placeholder-ish - suggests early ideation phase
- User seems open to collaborative exploration rather than having rigid requirements
- The emphasis on "us 2 chatting casually" suggests they want a conversational, iterative approach
- I'm curious what kind of prompt-related tool they're envisioning

## Questions/Hypotheses
- Is this going to be a prompt engineering tool?
- A prompt management system?
- Something for testing/evaluating prompts?
- A prompt template library?
- An AI assistant interface?
- A prompt optimization tool?

## Next Steps for Future Development
- Need to understand the user's vision through conversation
- Will likely need to help them clarify requirements
- Should be prepared to suggest different directions based on common prompt-related needs
- May need to prototype different approaches

## Technical Considerations (Premature but noting)
- Language choice not determined yet
- No dependencies or framework decisions made
- Could be web-based, CLI, desktop app, library, etc.
- Architecture completely open

## Project State
- Completely empty slate
- No existing code to analyze
- No documentation to review
- Pure ideation/planning phase
