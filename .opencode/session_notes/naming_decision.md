# Project Naming Decision

## Final Name: proompt
- Lowercase styling
- Logo concept: replace "oo" with infinity symbol (∞)
- Becomes "pr∞mpt" visually
- Fun to say, memorable
- Hints at infinite possibilities/combinations with templating system

## Why This Works
- Clearly prompt-related but distinctive
- Infinity symbol connects to the composition/templating concept
- Playful but not too cute
- Easy to pronounce and remember
- Good for branding (distinctive logo opportunity)
