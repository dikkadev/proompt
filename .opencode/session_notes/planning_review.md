# Planning Phase Review

## What We've Defined
- Clear positioning (between Langfuse and note apps)
- Core entities (prompts, snippets, notes)
- Templating system with variable precedence
- Metadata features (token counting, model tags, etc.)
- Organization (use case + tags)
- Git versioning as core feature
- Visual dependency system for variables
- Bidirectional prompt linking

## What's Still Open
- Snippet organization approach (tags vs folders vs other)
- Snippet naming/identification
- Actual UI design decisions
- Technology stack choices
- Database schema details

## Ready for Next Phase
We have enough design decisions to start thinking about:
1. Technology choices (language, framework, database)
2. Basic architecture (desktop app? web app? CLI?)
3. MVP scope (what to build first)
4. Database schema design

The core feature set is well-defined and the user seems satisfied with the planning.
