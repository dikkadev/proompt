# Session Continuation Context

## Where We Left Off
- Decided on name "proompt" with infinity symbol logo concept (pr∞mpt)
- Completed comprehensive feature design and planning phase
- All core features defined and documented
- Ready to move to next phase: implementation decisions

## Current Status
- Project is still greenfield (no code yet)
- Extensive planning documentation exists
- User wants to continue discussion about "important stuff"
- Need to determine what the next important decisions are

## What's Been Decided
✅ Core concept and positioning
✅ Data model (prompts, snippets, notes)
✅ Templating system with variables
✅ Organization approach (use cases + tags)
✅ Metadata features (token counting, model tags, etc.)
✅ Git-based versioning approach
✅ Variable precedence rules
✅ UI concepts for variable visualization

## What's Still Open
❓ Technology stack (language, framework, database)
❓ Application architecture (desktop? web? CLI?)
❓ MVP scope and build order
❓ Database schema design
❓ Snippet organization details

## Next Phase Candidates
1. Technology and architecture decisions
2. MVP scope definition
3. Database schema design
4. UI/UX mockups
5. Development setup and tooling

## User's Likely Intent
Based on "continue our discussion about the important stuff", they probably want to:
- Move from planning to implementation decisions
- Discuss technology choices
- Define MVP scope
- Start thinking about actual development

## My Approach
- Review what we've accomplished
- Identify the most important next decisions
- Present options for what to tackle next
- Let user guide the priority
