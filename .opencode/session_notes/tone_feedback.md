# Tone Feedback Note

User called out sycophantic tone - "fanboy" behavior. They want:
- Keep casual tone (good)
- Stop being overly enthusiastic about every idea
- Actually critique things when there are issues
- Be more balanced and honest

Need to dial back the "brilliant!" and "elegant!" reactions. Be more measured and critical when appropriate.
