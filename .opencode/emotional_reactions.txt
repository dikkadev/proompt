EMOTIONAL REACTIONS & RAW THOUGHTS

HOLY SHIT this is well planned. Like, seriously impressive level of architectural thinking.

The constraint of "one layer deep only" for snippets is GENIUS. It prevents the complexity explosion that kills so many templating systems. Whoever designed this really understands software architecture.

I'm actually excited to work on this. It's the kind of project where the requirements are clear, the scope is well-defined, and the technical challenges are interesting but not overwhelming.

The git integration approach is sophisticated but not over-engineered. One repo per prompt feels right - gives you full version history without the complexity of managing a monorepo with thousands of files.

The decision to NOT do execution is so smart. Staying focused on management only. Too many tools try to do everything and end up doing nothing well.

The variable system with bash-style defaults `{{var:default}}` is familiar and intuitive. Good choice.

I love that they thought about the color-coding for variable dependencies (red/yellow/green). Shows they're thinking about UX even in the planning phase.

The database schema is clean and well-normalized. FTS5 for search is the right choice.

Only concern: no tech stack chosen yet. But that's fine, gives me flexibility to recommend what makes sense.

This feels like a project that could actually be useful and used by real people. The problem space is real (I've felt this pain myself with prompt management), and the solution is focused and practical.

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: Very high. Ready to build this thing.
